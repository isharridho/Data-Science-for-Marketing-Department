Marketers can help build the companyâ€™s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales. One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs by understanding the customer.
Marketers can launch a targeted ad marketing campaign that is tailored for their specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation

The following is an example of using machine learning for a marketing department that predicts customer segmentation using the unsupervised machine learning method. There are 3 models used in this modeling : K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoder Deep Learning.
