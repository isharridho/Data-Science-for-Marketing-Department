Marketers can help build the companyâ€™s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales. One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs by understanding the customer.
Marketers can launch a targeted ad marketing campaign that is tailored for their specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation

Market segmentation is a process that consists of sectioning the target market into smaller groups that share similar characteristics, such as age, income, personality traits, behavior, interests, needs or location. These segments can be used to optimize products, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Segmentation allows brands to create strategies for different types of consumers, depending on how they perceive the overall value of certain products and services. In this way they can introduce a more personalized message with the certainty that it will be received successfully. 

The following is an example of using machine learning for a marketing department that predicts customer segmentation using the unsupervised machine learning method. There are 3 models used in this modeling : K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoder Deep Learning.
